practice program question
1.Ramesh's basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.

code:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
float bs,da,hra,gs;
printf("\n Enter basic salary:");
scanf("%f",&bs);
da=bs*0.4;
hra=bs*0.2;
gs=bs+da+hra;
printf("\n print basic salary %f",bs);
printf("\n DA %f",da);
printf("\n HRA %f",hra);
printf("\n GS %f",gs);
  return 0;
}

output:
Enter basic salary:8000
print basic salary 8000.000000
 DA 3200.000000
 HRA 1600.000000
 GS 12800.000000

2. The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters


code:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
float km,m,cm,ft,inch;
printf("\n enter the km:");
scanf("%f",&km);
m=km*1000;
cm=m*100;
inch=cm/2.54;
ft=inch/12;
printf("\n m:%f",m);
printf("\n cm:%f",cm);
printf("\n inch:%f",inch);
printf("\n ft:%f",ft);
return 0;
}

output:

enter the km:45
m:45000.000000
 cm:4500000.000000
 inch:1771653.500000
 ft:147637.796875


3. If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the keyboard, find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student. Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100

code:


#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,total,avg;
    printf("\n enter 5 marks:");
    scanf("%f%f%f%f%f",&m1,&m2,&m3,&m4,&m5);
    total=m1+m2+m3+m4+m5;
    avg=total/5.0;
    printf("\n enter the total mark: %f",total);
    printf("\n enter the avg percentage: %f",avg);
return 0;
}

output:
enter 5 marks:78
89
98
87
88
enter the total mark: 440.000000
 enter the avg percentage: 88.000000

4.Two numbers are input through the keyboard into two locations C and D. Write a program to interchange the contents of C and D.

CODE:


#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int c,d,b;
    printf("\n enter c &d value:");
    scanf("%d%d",&c,&d);
    printf("\n C:%d  D: %d",c,d);
    b=c;
    c=d;
    d=b;
      printf("\n C:%d  D:  %d",c,d);
return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
enter c &d value:5
6
C:5  D: 6
 C:6  D:  5
